[**Shisa 7B**](https://huggingface.co/augmxnt/shisa-7b-v1
) (`shisa-7b-v1`) is a bilingual Japanese and English (JA/EN) general-purpose chat model that aims to achieve strong Japanese language performance while retaining robust English capabilities, using a synthetic-data driven approach.

This repo is a WIP atm, needs a lot of cleanup, but most of the code is checked in and I didn't want to hold back release.

Most of the work for now is going into the project wiki: https://github.com/AUGMXNT/shisa/wiki
